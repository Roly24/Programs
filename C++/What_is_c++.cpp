/* 
What is C++?
The predecessor of C++ is C, which was designed by Dennis Richie al Bell Labs and fisrt
released in 1973

In  1983, Bjarne Stroustrup released C++. The ++ operator comes from the C increment operator ++.

Compilers
C++ is a high-level language, designed to give you a wealth of language facilities and to 
be readable for you and other developers. C++ allows you to split your code into functions,
which takes parameters and return value, so the memory used to pass this data

Linking the code
The compiler will produce an output. For C++ code, this will be object code, but you may
have other compiler outputs, such as compiled resource files.

Source files
At the very basic level, a C++ project will contain just one file: the C++ source file, typically
with the extension cpp or cxx.
